# Data Analytics Assessment: Sales Intelligence Pipeline

## Project Overview

 **This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, acting as a** **Junior Data Analyst**. The objective was to transform raw, messy sales data into actionable business intelligence using a professional modular approach. The project covers data cleaning (Python), relational modeling (Star Schema), database migration (SQL), and advanced visualization (Power BI).

## 🛠️ Python ETL Pipeline

**The data underwent a rigorous** **Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL)** **process using Pandas and SQLAlchemy.**

### 1. Cleaning & Normalization

* **Text Standardisation:** **Applied** **unicodedata** **to remove accents, special characters (**@**), and converted all text to lowercase with underscores for SQL compatibility.**
* **Data Imputation:**

  * **Categorical nulls (Region, Product) were filled using the** **Mode**.
  * **Numerical nulls (Price, Discount) were filled using the** **Mean**.
  * **Logic Reconciliation:** **The** **total** **column was recalculated using the formula:** **(Quantity * Unit_Price) - Discount + Shipping_Cost**.
* **Feature Engineering:** **Created derived columns:** **year**, **month**, **total_ventas**, and **segmento_cliente** **(calculated via quantiles).**

### 2. Loading

**Used** **SQLAlchemy** **to establish a secure connection via** **.env** **variables, automating the migration of 4 normalized tables into the** **Assessment** **database.**

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Key findings from the Python-based analysis:**

* **Distribution:** **Sales follow a right-skewed distribution with significant outliers representing premium transactions.**
* **Trend Analysis:** **Identified seasonality with revenue peaks in specific months, suggesting a need for inventory adjustments.**
* **Correlation:** **A Heatmap of** **Region vs. Category** **identified "Hot Spots" where specific product categories dominate local markets.**

## 🗄️ Database Architecture: Star Schema

 **To optimize query performance and reporting, the flat data was normalized into a** **Star Schema**:

* **Fact Table:** **fact_ventas** **(Contains IDs, Quantity, and Revenue metrics).**
* **Dimension Tables:**

  * **dim_productos**: Product names, types, and unit prices.
  * **dim_regiones**: Geographic data (City, Country).
  * **dim_clientes**: Customer types and segments.

## 🔍 SQL Analysis

**The following intermediate and advanced queries were developed to extract business value:**

### 1. Top 5 Products by Revenue

**code**SQL

```
SELECT p.producto, SUM(v.total_ventas) as revenue
FROM fact_ventas v
JOIN dim_productos p ON v.id_producto = p.id_producto
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 5;
```

* **Purpose:** **Identifying hero products for stock priority.**

### 2. Year-over-Year (YoY) Comparison

**code**SQL

```
SELECT year, total_sales,
LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY year) as last_year,
((total_sales - LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY year)) / LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY year)) * 100 as yoy_growth
FROM annual_sales_summary;
```

* **Purpose:** **Measuring annual growth momentum.**

### 3. Customer Ranking (**DENSE_RANK**)

**Used to classify customers based on total spend without skipping ranks in case of ties.**

---

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard

**The final interactive report includes:**

* **KPI Cards:** **Total Sales, Average Ticket, and % YoY Growth.**
* **Geographic Map:** **Revenue distribution by country.**
* **Donut Chart:** **Market share participation per product category.**
* **Rankings:** **Top 5 Products and Customer Segments.**

## 💡 Key Business Insights

* **Revenue Risk:** **45% of total revenue is generated by only 3 products.** **Recommendation:** **Diversify the portfolio or secure priority supply chains for these SKUs.**
* **Upselling Potential:** **The "Premium" segment has a 2.8x higher Average Ticket but low transaction frequency.** **Recommendation:** **Targeted loyalty campaigns to move "Standard" customers into the "Premium" tier.**
* **Market Expansion:** **4 regions show high population but less than 5% sales share.** **Recommendation:** **Pilot marketing campaigns in these "Cold Spots" using the top-performing categories.**

## 🏁 Conclusion

**This project successfully transformed raw data into a structured analytical ecosystem. By implementing a modular ETL pipeline, a robust SQL Star Schema, and an interactive Dashboard, the business can now move from reactive reporting to proactive, data-driven decision-making.**
